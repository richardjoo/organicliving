  <h1>Organic Living</h1>
  <p>Every human being, living organisms deserve to live healthy life.</p>



  <h2>First-Timer</h2>
  <p>We still are first timers here.  We knew and aware of organic foods and vaguly knew the organic products are good, but did not know exactly why.</p>
  <p>It is absolutely stressful when you decide to go organic and start dig into the dark side of non organic, gmo products and how bad it is.</p>
  <p>I hope this page can help you understand why you should go organic and what to do.</p>



  <h2>Why Organic?</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Can save the dying and disappearing bees</li>
        <blockquote>“If the bee disappeared off the face of the earth, man would only have four years left to live.” ― Albert Einstein</blockquote>
  </ul>

  <h3>Organics can feed the hungry world <a href="http://www.cornucopia.org/2012/10/only-organics-can-feed-the-hungry-world-heres-why/?gclid=CJCul7qQ8rgCFYl_Qgod70MAyA" target="_bkank">[...]</a></h3>

    <ul>
      <li>ill effects of pesticide residues on conventionally-grown produce</li>
      <li>the hormones and antibiotic-resistant bacteria that taint factory-farmed meat and poultry</li>
      <li>Processed foods: the health impact of the chemical food additives, dyes, preservatives and genetically modified foods which are allowed in conventional products, but not in those which are labeled “organic.”</li>
      <li>the environmental impact of its opposite, non organic does the chemical-intensive agriculture that dominates the American landscape and much of the globe</li>

  <h3>10 Good Reasons To Go Organic <a href="http://www.ota.com/organic_and_you/10reasons.html" target="_blank">[...]</a></h3>


    <ul>
      <li>Organic products meet stringent standards</li>
        <dd>Organic certification is the public’s assurance that products have been grown and handled according to strict procedures without persistent toxic chemical inputs.</dd>
      <li>Organic food tastes great!</li>
        <dd>It’s common sense – well-balanced soils produce strong, healthy plants that become nourishing food for people and animals.</dd>
      <li>Organic production reduces health risks</li>
        <dd>Many EPA-approved pesticides were registered long before extensive research linked these chemicals to cancer and other diseases. Organic agriculture is one way to prevent any more of these chemicals from getting into the air, earth and water that sustain us.</dd>
      <li>Organic farms respect our water resources</li>
        <dd>The elimination of polluting chemicals and nitrogen leaching, done in combination with soil building, protects and conserves water resources.</dd>
      <li>Organic farmers build healthy soil</li>
        <dd>Soil is the foundation of the food chain. The primary focus of organic farming is to use practices that build healthy soils.</dd>
      <li>Organic farmers work in harmony with nature</li>
        <dd>Organic agricultural respects the balance demanded of a healthy ecosystem: wildlife is encouraged by including forage crops in rotation and by retaining fence rows, wetlands, and other natural areas.</dd>
      <li>Organic producers are leaders in innovative research</li>
        <dd>Organic farmers have led the way, largely at their own expense, with innovative on-farm research aimed at reducing pesticide use and minimizing agriculture’s impact on the environment.</dd>
      <li>Organic producers strive to preserve diversity</li>
        <dd>The loss of a large variety of species (biodiversity) is one of the most pressing environmental concerns. The good news is that many organic farmers and gardeners have been collecting and preserving seeds, and growing unusual varieties for decades.</dd>
      <li>Organic farming helps keep rural communities healthy</li>
        <dd>USDA reported that in 1997, half of U.S. farm production came from only 2% of farms. Organic agriculture can be a lifeline for small farms because it offers an alternative market where sellers can command fair prices for crops.</dd>
      <li>Organic abundance – Foods and non-foods alike!</li>
        <dd>Now every food category has an organic alternative. And non-food agricultural products are being grown organically – even cotton, which most experts felt could not be grown this way.</dd>
    </ul>

  <h3>Five reasons organic food is good for you and the planet <a href="http://www.grassrootsonline.org/news/articles/five-reasons-organic-food-good-you-and-planet" target="_bkank">[...]</a></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>organic agriculture feeds the earth, not just the consumer. While not all organic farms are the same, by and large they replace key elements to the soil naturally. Industrial farming, on the other hand, saps nutrients from the soil, thus requiring increasing amounts of fertilizers or other additives to maintain yield year after year. And year after year, the soil erodes. This “rinse and repeat” cycle leaves us with infertile soil, heaps of chemicals and mounting pollution.</li>

      <li>do we really want hormones with our calcium? Or antibiotics in our chicken thighs? As Food Inc. so graphically showed us, 80 percent of antibiotics used in the US today are used by the meat and poultry industries to accelerate animal growth and avoid diseases in crowded environments. Organic agriculture eschews such additives in favor of alternative conditions in raising animals.</li>

      <li>since we are not pests (at least genetically), why do we need to ingest pesticides? Pesticides used in industrial agriculture may fall below the EPA standard, but those standards are also set by corporate lobbyists on behalf of big agribusiness. Concerns about pesticides range from increased allergies and illnesses, to the rise of “super bugs.” In fact, the same Stanford study that raised such a ruckus about nutritional values also concluded that, “Consumption of organic foods may reduce exposure to pesticide residues and antibiotic-resistant bacteria.”</li>

      <li>farmers and their crops are connected to the planet. Runoff from Iowa’s pesticides, fertilizers and herbicides flows down the Mississippi River and into the Gulf of Mexico. There, they produce algae blooms, which take oxygen out of the water. Such activity results in aptly named “dead zones” where fish and other aquatic life cannot survive.</li>

      <li>organic agriculture is healthier for the farmer. Farmworkers engaged in industrial fields, spraying chemicals or harvesting pesticide-laced vegetables suffer certain cancers and other diseases at far higher levels than average. Whether or not consumers ingest these pesticides at levels high enough to cause harm, the fact that workers face serious maladies to produce our food raises alarm.</li>
