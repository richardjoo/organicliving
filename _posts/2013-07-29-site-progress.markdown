### What's happening?
A lot of things happened here, and I was finally able to make my `base site` running all properly.  I started to add more contents and see how it would look like.  It is not the gretest, but it will help me navigate through the site when I need information pulled quickly.

You can check out some of the pages I have created.
This [Resources][resource_url] page now contains `others` section that I list some interesting pages.


### What's next?
Well, I am constantly working on the page, but things are not moving as fast I wished it to be.  so, let's see how it goes~

I will add more links to the resources and also update more contents
