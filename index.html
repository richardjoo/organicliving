  <h1>Welcome to organic living</h1>

  <div>
  	<p>When my wife and I started watching some documentary shows, we were in shock, still in shock, to find out what really is going on in the world, and how horrible it is.  We kept on watching more and more documentary shows and we learned more shocking stories and issues related to the very baisc things we lived without even thinking too much about it.</p>

	<p>Here we are, now we are trying to eat organic, non-gmo foods and trying to use chemical free non-toxic house hold products and got ton of stress because we were overwhelmed and did not know what to do or what to buy or where to go.  So, we started digging and searching and studying.</p>

	<p>This page is mainly for us to keep track of what we have found, what kind of products we need to use, what kind of food we are buying from where, what kind of chemicals are harmful to us etc etc.</p>

	<p>There are ton of websites out there and we are truly thankful for so many people's hard work.  And we simply decided to put it in one location so we can access easily.  And hope others can benefit from this site as well.</p>

	<p>This site is still work in progress. so, if we have missed any, or found any mistakes, please feel free to give us a buzz so we can fix things.</p>
